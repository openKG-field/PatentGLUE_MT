Insulated wall panel consisting of a foam layer and a hardboard. The rear surface of the foam layer is parallel to the front surface of the hard fiberboard, and the upper and lower surfaces thereof are V-shaped parallel to each other, and the upper surface is used for collecting moisture. The hardboard is joined to the hardboard of the adjacent wallboard in a lap joint so that there is a space between the interlocking foam layers for filling the sponge layer. Upper and lower grooves are formed in the foam layer between the hardboard and the foam layer, and horizontal grooves are formed across the bottom of the foam layer to provide a network for transporting moisture. An isolating device is used between the hardboard and the wall to keep the distance between the two to prevent the foam layer from being pressed.
Method and apparatus for adding labels to plastic blow molding machine molds
A method and apparatus for adding a label to a mold of a plastic blow molding machine. The blow molding machine has a plurality of sets of molds mounted on a rotating wheel that rotates about a horizontal axis. The molds are moved closer to each other or opened to load the parison, and the parison is then blow molded into a cavity between the molds. This includes taking the label out of the one or more cells in turn, placing it on a recirculating conveyor, and then feeding the label to an adjacent location of the mold opening, transferring the label laterally from the conveyor belt to a position within the mold. When the mold is closed with the parison and the parison is blown, the label and the blow bottle are bonded together.
TV display control circuit wiring
The circuit wiring relates to a scrolling operation of one or several areas of the display screen, which comprises: a bitmap memory, at least one circuit chip for generating and controlling signals, one or more data signal channel circuit chips, connected to each part of the circuit Timing circuits and logic circuits between. It is thus possible to perform refresh, scroll and update operations in response to a plurality of timing loops during each horizontal scan. The circuit wiring described above rewrites the entire bitmap memory during one vertical scanning period of the display device, thereby providing the system with a fast and smooth scrolling operation and continuous addressing operation of the memory.
Integrated circuit for arithmetic operations and display
An integrated circuit for performing arithmetic operations and display control is coupled to and powered by the power source (46) and the liquid crystal display (45), and includes: an arithmetic operation circuit (42) for performing a specified arithmetic operation, wherein the arithmetic operation The result is shown on the display; a boost circuit (43) receives and boosts the voltage from the power supply (46); an excitation circuit (44) is powered by the boost circuit (43) to energize the liquid crystal display (45); The control circuit (41) is for interrupting the excitation of the display when the arithmetic operation circuit (42) performs an arithmetic operation.
Valve with movable sealing structure
The invention belongs to the improvement of the sealing and structure of the valve, and is composed of a sealing structural member, a planar coupling member and a pressure regulating mechanism. The sealing structure is an elastic material. This structure reduces the sealing surface to the smallest possible extent. This is extremely advantageous for the processing of flat mating parts, and the ordinary lathe can be satisfied, reforming the finishing grinding that has been used for decades. The valve of the invention not only has convenient processing, simple structure, but also can withstand pressure of 50kg/cm2, the rotating torque is one-fifth to one-twentieth of the plane sealing valve, the service life is long (up to 100,000 times), and the cost is low.
The fuel cell
The fuel cell (8) includes a fuel electrode, an oxidant electrode, and an electrolyte disposed between the two electrodes. In order to control the amount of methanol in the conduit (9) for supplying fuel to the fuel cell (8), a methanol concentration control device (10) is disposed at the conduit (9), and the single cell (15) in the detection (10) is used. The open circuit voltage is controlled by the open circuit potential of the oxidant battery (2).
